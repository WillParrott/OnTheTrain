This is a little python3 script to enable the user to play the classic drinking game 'On The Train'. To play, you will need to pull OnTheTrain.py and Stations.txt to the same directory and run the python script.   
For those of you unfamiliar with the rules, the game is very simple.
A player must correctly guess the colour of a card, then if the next card is higher or lower than the previous card, then if the next card is between the previous two cards or outside of them, for example, Jack is 'in' 7 and King, and 6 is 'out'. Finally, the player must guess the suit of the next card. At any stage of the game, an incorrect guess results in the player having a drink, and returning to the beginning of the game(i.e. colour). Ace is high, and bastard rules in the higher/lower and in/out rounds mean that a card of the same value is wrong, and results in a drink and restarting the game. There are no brakes on the train; a player must get four in a row correct to be able to type "Brake" and complete the game.
It's also important for the conductor (the person who reads the cards and comments out to the player, unless you're playing on your own like a proper piss-head) to regularly remind the player that "Ace is high!", and "It's always clubs!". This last comment is meaningless, but very much in the spirit of the game. The game will also suggest other comments at random, and you can always add to this list of comments to put your own spin on the game.
An optional extra rule is that a player must skull his or her drink if he or she gets the last card wrong.
Toggling stats mode will allow the conductor to view the probability of the next card being red/black higher/lower in/out and a particular suit.
Enjoy!
